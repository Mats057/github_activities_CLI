## Getting Started

To use this application, you need to provide a username as a Java argument before running it. After that, you will be able to see the most recent activities of the specified user.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders and a default class:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `src/GitHubActivities.java`: the default Class to run application

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## About
The project idea comes from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) and was created to improve my knowledge of the Java language. Feel free to check out the code!
